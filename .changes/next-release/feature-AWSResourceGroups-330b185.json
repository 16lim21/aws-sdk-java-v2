    "description": "Resource Groups released a new feature that enables you to create a group with an associated configuration that specifies how other AWS services interact with the group. There are two new operations `GroupResources` and `UngroupResources` to work on a group with a configuration. In this release, you can associate EC2 Capacity Reservations with a resource group. Resource Groups also added a new request parameter `Group` to replace `GroupName` for all existing operations."
