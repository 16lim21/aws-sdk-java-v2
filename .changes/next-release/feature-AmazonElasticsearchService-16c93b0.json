    "description": "UltraWarm storage provides a cost-effective way to store large amounts of read-only data on Amazon Elasticsearch Service. Rather than attached storage, UltraWarm nodes use Amazon S3 and a sophisticated caching solution to improve performance. For indices that you are not actively writing to and query less frequently, UltraWarm storage offers significantly lower costs per GiB. In Elasticsearch, these warm indices behave just like any other index. You can query them using the same APIs or use them to create dashboards in Kibana."
