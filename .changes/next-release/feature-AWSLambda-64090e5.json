    "description": "Added the function state and update status to the output of GetFunctionConfiguration and other actions. Check the state information to ensure that a function is ready before you perform operations on it. Functions take time to become ready when you connect them to a VPC.Added the EventInvokeConfig type and operations to configure error handling options for asynchronous invocation. Use PutFunctionEventInvokeConfig to configure the number of retries and the maximum age of events when you invoke the function asynchronously.Added on-failure and on-success destination settings for asynchronous invocation. Configure destinations to send an invocation record to an SNS topic, an SQS queue, an EventBridge event bus, or a Lambda function.Added error handling options to event source mappings. This enables you to configure the number of retries, configure the maximum age of records, or retry with smaller batches when an error occurs when a function processes a Kinesis or DynamoDB stream.Added the on-failure destination setting to event source mappings. This enables you to send discarded events to an SNS topic or SQS queue when all retries fail or when the maximum record age is exceeded when a function processes a Kinesis or DynamoDB stream.Added the ParallelizationFactor option to event source mappings to increase concurrency per shard when a function processes a Kinesis or DynamoDB stream."
