    "description": "Introducing instance refresh, a feature that helps you update all instances in an Auto Scaling group in a rolling fashion (for example, to apply a new AMI or instance type). You can control the pace of the refresh by defining the percentage of the group that must remain running/healthy during the replacement process and the time for new instances to warm up between replacements."
