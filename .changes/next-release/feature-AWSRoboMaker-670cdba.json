    "description": "Support for Connectivity to Simulation. When you need to interact with the applications in your simulation job, you can connect to your robot application or simulation application with port forwarding. When you configure port forwarding, traffic will be forwarded from the simulation job port to the application port. Port forwarding makes it easy to connect with tools such as ROS Bridge and other tools. This can be useful when you want to debug or run custom tools to interact with your applications."
