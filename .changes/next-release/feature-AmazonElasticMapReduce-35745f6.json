    "description": "Amazon EMR has introduced an account level configuration called Block Public Access that allows you to block clusters with ports open to traffic from public IP sources (i.e. 0.0.0.0/0 for IPv4 and ::/0 for IPv6) from launching. Individual ports or port ranges can be added as exceptions to allow public access."
