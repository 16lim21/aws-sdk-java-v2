    "description": "With this release, you can call ModifySubnetAttribute with two new parameters: MapCustomerOwnedIpOnLaunch and CustomerOwnedIpv4Pool, to map a customerOwnedIpv4Pool to a subnet. You will also see these two new fields in the DescribeSubnets response. If your subnet has a customerOwnedIpv4Pool mapped, your network interface will get an auto assigned customerOwnedIpv4 address when placed onto an instance."
