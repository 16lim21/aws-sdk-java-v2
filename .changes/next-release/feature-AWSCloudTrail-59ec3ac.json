    "description": "1. This release adds two new APIs, GetInsightSelectors and PutInsightSelectors, which let you configure CloudTrail Insights event delivery on a trail. An Insights event is a new type of event that is generated when CloudTrail detects unusual activity in your AWS account. In this release, only \"ApiCallRateInsight\" is a supported Insights event type. 2. This release also adds the new \"ExcludeManagementEventSource\" option to the existing PutEventSelectors API. This field currently supports only AWS Key Management Services."
