    "description": "You can now use SageMaker Autopilot for automatically training and tuning candidate models using a combination of various feature engineering, ML algorithms, and hyperparameters determined from the user's input data. SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning now supports tuning across multiple algorithms. With Amazon SageMaker Experiments users can create Experiments, ExperimentTrials, and ExperimentTrialComponents to track, organize, and evaluate their ML training jobs. With Amazon SageMaker Debugger, users can easily debug training jobs using a number of pre-built rules provided by Amazon SageMaker, or build custom rules. With Amazon SageMaker Processing, users can run on-demand, distributed, and fully managed jobs for data pre- or post- processing or model evaluation. With Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor, a user can create MonitoringSchedules to automatically monitor endpoints to detect data drift and other issues and get alerted on them. This release also includes the preview version of Amazon SageMaker Studio with Domains, UserProfiles, and Apps. This release also includes the preview version of Amazon Augmented AI to easily implement human review of machine learning predictions by creating FlowDefinitions, HumanTaskUis, and HumanLoops."
