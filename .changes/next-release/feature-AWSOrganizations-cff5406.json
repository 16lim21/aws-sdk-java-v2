    "description": "AI services opt out policies enable you to control what AI service data is collected and stored for the accounts in your organization. By default, AWS artificial intelligence (AI) services collect and store data as part of operating and supporting the continuous improvement life cycle for each service. You can use these policies to opt out of this process for all of your AWS accounts to ensure that your data is not persisted within AWS AI service data stores or used for service improvements."
