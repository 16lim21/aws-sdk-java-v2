    "description": "Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling now supports Instance Weighting and Max Instance Lifetime. Instance Weighting allows specifying the capacity units for each instance type included in the MixedInstancesPolicy and how they would contribute to your application's performance. Max Instance Lifetime allows specifying the maximum length of time that an instance can be in service. If any instances are approaching this limit, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling gradually replaces them."
